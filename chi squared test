        Pearson's Chi-squared test

data:  D
X-squared = 14.464, df = 2, p-value = 0.0007232
> # p value < los, Therefore reject H0
> # There is association between smoking habit and hypertension

        Chi-squared test for given probabilities

data:  x
X-squared = 4.1667, df = 6, p-value = 0.6541
> # los = 5%
> # P value > los, Therefore accept H0
> # Conclusion : Accidents are evenly distributed

        One Sample t-test

data:  D
t = 25.152, df = 11, p-value = 4.515e-11
alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 23.91189 28.49811
sample estimates:
mean of x 
   26.205 
> # H0 : m1 = m2
> # H1 : m1 != m2
> # p value < los(5%), Therefore accpet H0


> a = c(10, 6, 16, 17, 13, 12, 8, 14, 15, 9)
> b = c(7, 13, 22, 15, 12, 14, 18, 21, 23, 10, 17)
> # H0 : s1^2=s2^2
> # H1 : s1^2!=s2^2
> var.test(a, b)

        F test to compare two variances

data:  a and b
F = 0.51175, num df = 9, denom df = 10, p-value = 0.328
alternative hypothesis: true ratio of variances is not equal to 1
95 percent confidence interval:
 0.1354199 2.0284958
sample estimates:
ratio of variances 
         0.5117469 
> # lost = 5%
> # p value < los, reject H0
> # There is difference in variances
